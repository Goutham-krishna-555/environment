## 📖 How It Works  

1. **Buttons for Topics**:  
   - The webpage provides four main buttons: **Climate**, **Consumption**, **Resources**, and **People**.  
   - Clicking a button changes the background, displays a new widget, and updates the call-to-action text.  

2. **Dynamic Frames**:  
   - Embedded frames from *The World Counts* show data and statistics relevant to the selected topic.  

3. **Carbon Footprint Calculator**:  
   - Users can calculate their individual carbon footprint directly from the webpage using the embedded calculator.
